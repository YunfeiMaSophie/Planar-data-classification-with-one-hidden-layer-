# Planar-data-classification-with-one-hidden-layer-
A neural network with one hidden layer. 

There is a big difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression.  

- Implemented a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Used units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh 
- Computed the cross entropy loss 
- Implemented forward and backward propagation
